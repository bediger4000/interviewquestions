# Programming Interview Questions and Puzzles

Like a lot of people, I subscribe to [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).
I also read reddit and other sites and sometimes do the interview problem or puzzle just
to see if I can.

This repo collects links to other repos of mine that contain solutions to interview questions and puzzles.

* [Binary tree](https://github.com/bediger4000/binary_tree) problems. There's a bunch in here.
* [k-ary tree symmetry](https://github.com/bediger4000/tree_symmetry) determine whether a tree with arbitrary number of children is symmetric.
* [Linked list](https://github.com/bediger4000/linked_lists) problems. This repo contains several interview questions.
* [RPN calculator](https://github.com/bediger4000/reverse-polish-problem) Reverse polish notation calculator.
* [Collatz conjecture](https://github.com/bediger4000/collatz-conjecture-puzzle) question.
* [Array rotation algorithms](https://github.com/bediger4000/array-rotation-algorithms), these come up a lot.
* [List manipulation problem](https://github.com/bediger4000/addition_puzzle), do 2 numbers in a list add to a given sum.
* [Reverse a string](https://github.com/bediger4000/golang-unicode-string-reversal), a silly problem, but it has depths if it's a Unicode string.
* [Print a string zig-zag](https://github.com/bediger4000/zigzag-programming-problem)
* [Estimate Pi](https://github.com/bediger4000/estimate_pi) using a Monte Carlo method. People have done this in the real world.
* [Find if a string could be a palindrome anagram](https://github.com/bediger4000/possible-palindromes)
* [Recreate binary search tree from a post-order traversal](https://github.com/bediger4000/postorder-tree-traversal) I think this algorithm is unique.
* [AVL binary search trees](https://github.com/bediger4000/avl_tree). This would be an advanced interview question indeed.
* [String representation of binary tree](https://github.com/bediger4000/binary-tree-odd-string-rep). You may not get what you are looking for.
* [Great Tree List Recursion Problem, Go](https://github.com/bediger4000/tree-list-recursion-go)
* [Great Tree List Recursion Problem, C](https://github.com/bediger4000/tree-list-recursion-c)
* [Pour water from jug to jug](https://github.com/bediger4000/egyptian-waterjar-puzzle) just to get a non-jugful amount.
* [Kaprekar's Constant](https://github.com/bediger4000/kaprekar)
* [Flipping N fair coins](https://github.com/bediger4000/fair-coin-flipping), eliminating all that come up tails, then repeating.
* [Soundex algorithm](https://github.com/bediger4000/soundex), Soundex in Go.
* [Roman numerals to decimal](https://github.com/bediger4000/romannumerals)
* [Sort list](https://github.com/bediger4000/reverselistsort) using only an array-reverse operation.
* [Boggle-like game](https://github.com/bediger4000/boggle-question) find a word according to Boggle-game rules
* [Balanced parens/brackets/braces](https://github.com/bediger4000/balanced-parens)
* [Run-length encoding](https://github.com/bediger4000/runlength-encoding)
* [Job scheduler](https://github.com/bediger4000/jobscheduler)
* [Markov chain](https://github.com/bediger4000/markov-chain)

I've tried to either solve them in a uniqure or lesser-known fashion, or explore them more fully.
I've also tried to include an analysis of the question,
maybe from a programming point of view,
but also from the point of view of what an interviewer could legitimately expect from a developer in an interview, and why.

My takeaway after looking at all of these is that Daily Coding Problem doesn't rate a problem very accurately.
Job candidates simply can't feel bad if an interviewer asks what they
consider an "easy" problem, and the candidate can't solve it.
A lot of these problems require insight that might not arrive in the stress of an interview.
The flip side of this is that the interviewer should have some solution in mind,
a solution appropriate for the job in question,
and the seniority of the candidate.
The interviewer might not get what they're interested in from any given candidate.
