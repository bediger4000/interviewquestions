# Programming Interview Questions and Puzzles

Like a lot of people, I subscribe to [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).
I also read reddit and other sites and sometimes do the interview problem or puzzle just
to see if I can.

This repo collects links to other repos of mine that contain solutions to interview questions and puzzles.

* [Binary tree](https://github.com/bediger4000/binary_tree) problems.
This repo contains a number of problems,
and a tree package (it's in Go) to make
solving the problems less repetitious.
  * Invert a binary tree
  * Breadth-first traverse
  * Return the maximum depth and/or the deepest node
  * Reconstruct original tree from pre-order and in-order traversals
  * Find all paths from root to leaves
  * Print tree nodes' values in boustrophedon order
  * Print "cousin" nodes of a given node
  * Prune a tree so all subtrees that have a 0-valued node are removed
  * Minimum-height binary search tree from a sorted array
  * Find lowest-common ancestor of a given node. Assume pointer to parent node
  * Count nodes in a "complete" binary tree in less than linear time
  * Determine whether a binary tree is height-balanced
  * Return the "inorder successor" (next biggest node) of a given node in a binary tree
  * Find the "bottom view" of a binary tree
  * Given a binary tree, find a minimum path sum from root to a leaf
  * Find nodes of a tree with values inside a given range
  * Implement locking in a binary tree. Weird locking, but locking.
  * Count "unival subtrees" in a binary tree
  * Merge two binary trees
  * Find the largest sub-tree having the binary search tree property of a tree
  * Serialize/deserialize a binary tree
  * Generate a finite, but arbitrarily large binary tree in O(1) time
  * Find the second-largest value in a binary search tree
  * Flatten a binary tree into linked list in place, pre-order-traverse-order
* [k-ary tree symmetry](https://github.com/bediger4000/tree_symmetry) determine whether a tree with arbitrary number of children is symmetric.
* [Linked list](https://github.com/bediger4000/linked_lists) problems.
This repo contains solutions to several interview questions,
all in Go,
and a Go linked list package to make solving problems less repetitious.
  * Build a stack from a linked list
  * Implement a queue using two stacks. This is an old standby.
  * Merge two sorted linked lists
  * Find the middle item of a linked list
  * Merge K sorted linked lists
  * Reverse a linked list in place. Another old, familiar face.
  * Is a singly-linked list palindromic?
  * The classic "XOR next and previous pointers", harder to do in type safe Go.
  * Remove kth Last element of a list
  * Rotate a list by k elements
  * Swap every two nodes of a list
  * Determine if a doubly-linked list is a palindrome
  * Add two numbers, each represented as a linked list of single place values
  * Partition a linked list, given a partition value
  * Sort a linked list numerically by node values
  * Remove consecutive list nodes whose value sums to zero
  * Remove a node in the middle of the list
  * Find intersection of 2 non-cyclical linked lists
* [RPN calculator](https://github.com/bediger4000/reverse-polish-problem) Reverse polish notation calculator.
* [Collatz conjecture](https://github.com/bediger4000/collatz-conjecture-puzzle) question.

* [Reverse a string](https://github.com/bediger4000/golang-unicode-string-reversal), a silly problem, but it has depths if it's a Unicode string.

I've tried to either solve them in a unique or lesser-known fashion,
or explore them more fully with alternate solutions.
I've also tried to include an analysis of the question,
from the point of view of what an interviewer could legitimately expect
from a developer, and what a developer could do with a problem.

---

My takeaway after looking at all of these interview questions
is that Daily Coding Problem doesn't rate a problem very accurately.
Even non-Daily Coding Problem interview questions are often outlandish,
answers are required in an unreasonably short time frame.
Job candidates simply can't feel bad if an interviewer asks what they
consider an "easy" problem, and the candidate can't solve it.
A lot of these problems require insight that might not arrive in the stress of an interview.
The flip side of this is that the interviewer should have some solution in mind,
a solution appropriate for the job in question,
and the seniority of the candidate.
The interviewer might not get what they're interested in from any given candidate.
