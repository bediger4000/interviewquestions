# Programming Interview Questions and Puzzles

Like a lot of people, I subscribe to [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).
I also read reddit and other sites and sometimes do the interview problem or puzzle just
to see if I can.

This repo collects links to other repos of mine that contain solutions to interview questions and puzzles.

* [Binary tree](https://github.com/bediger4000/binary_tree) problems. There's a bunch in here.
* [Linked list](https://github.com/bediger4000/linked_lists) problems. This repo contains several interview questions.
* [Collatz conjecture](https://github.com/bediger4000/collatz-conjecture-puzzle) question.
* [Array rotation algorithms](https://github.com/bediger4000/array-rotation-algorithms), these come up a lot.
* [List manipulation problem](https://github.com/bediger4000/addition_puzzle), do 2 numbers in a list add to a given sum.
* [Reverse a string](https://github.com/bediger4000/golang-unicode-string-reversal), a silly problem, but it has depths if it's a Unicode string.
* [Print a string zig-zag](https://github.com/bediger4000/zigzag-programming-problem)
* [Monte Carlo method estimate Pi](https://github.com/bediger4000/estimate_pi)https://github.com/bediger4000/estimate_pio
* [Find if a string could be a palindrome anagram](https://github.com/bediger4000/possible-palindromes)
* [Recreate binary search tree from a post-order traversal](https://github.com/bediger4000/postorder-tree-traversal) I think this algorithm is unique.
* [AVL binary search trees](https://github.com/bediger4000/avl_tree). This would be an advanced interview question indeed.
* [String representation of binary tree](https://github.com/bediger4000/binary-tree-odd-string-rep). You may not get what you are looking for.
* [Great Tree List Recursion Problem, Go](https://github.com/bediger4000/tree-list-recursion-go)
* [Great Tree List Recursion Problem, C](https://github.com/bediger4000/tree-list-recursion-c)
* [Pour water from jug to jug](https://github.com/bediger4000/egyptian-waterjar-puzzle) just to get a non-jugful amount.

I've tried to either solve them in a uniqure or lesser-known fashion, or explore them more fully.
I've also tried to include an analysis of the question,
maybe from a programming point of view,
but also from the point of view of what you could legitimately expect from a developer in an interview.
